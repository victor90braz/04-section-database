# Installation

To create a new Laravel project named "app-example," run the following command:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel app-example
```
````

# Running the Application

To start the development server, use the following command:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

# Connect to the Database

You can connect to your MySQL database using the following command:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

# Migrate the Database

To create the necessary database tables, run the migration with:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

# Steps for Creating Models

To create a new migration and model for your "Post" entity, use the following commands:

1. Create a migration for the "posts" table:

```bash
php artisan make:migration create_posts_table
```

2. Create a model for the "Post" entity:

```bash
php artisan make:model Post
```

# Creating a New User and Adding It to the Database Using Tinker

To create a new user and add it to the database, you can use Laravel's Tinker. First, run Tinker with the following command:

```bash
php artisan tinker
```

Now, let's go through the steps in the Tinker session.

1. Create a new user instance:

```php
$user = new User();
```

2. Set the user's name, email, and password:

```php
$user->name = 'mario';
$user->email = 'mario@gmail.com';
$user->password = bcrypt('!mario');
```

3. Save the user to the database:

```php
$user->save();
```

4. Retrieve the user from the database (for example, by ID):

```php
$user->find(1);
```

This sequence of commands creates a new user with the provided information and stores it in your database.

# Creating a New Post and Adding It to the Database Using Tinker

To create a new post and add it to the database, you can follow similar steps in Tinker:

1. Create a new post instance:

```php
$post = new Post();
```

2. Set the post's title, excerpt, and body:

```php
$post->title = 'My First Post Database';
$post->excerpt = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.';
$post->body = 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed nec facilisis risus. Vivamus vehicula vestibulum eros, id fermentum augue. Cras fringilla, urna nec aliquet pellentesque, eros mi scelerisque ante, id condimentum massa nisl non tellus.';
```

3. Save the post to the database:

```php
$post->save();
```
